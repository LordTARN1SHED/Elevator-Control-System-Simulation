# Elevator-Control-System-Simulation
 This project involves the design and implementation of a control system simulating the operation of a 4-floor elevator. The system includes inputs and outputs to mimic real elevator functionality, including buttons, display lights, motor control, and door operations. The program is developed in assembly language.
